        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Kevin. I am currently a student at UCR. I am still undeclared, but I have decided to focus on economics or business. I have three siblings. One is older and two are younger. The older one is four years older than me and he even went to UCR, as well. He majored in chemical engineering. The younger is nine years younger than me, while the youngest is twelve years younger than me. The age gap may seem large, but we get along pretty well. I grew up in Bellflower, California, but recently moved to Cerritos. My hobbies include playing video games, watching Netflix, and hanging out with friends. I enjoy cooking, but I am only a beginner at it. I would love to learn more, but I can't bring myself to buy new ingredients to experiment with. This is mainly because I'm scared that I will mess up or I will only make a dish once before the ingredients go bad. I only have a few months worth of job experience. Last summer, I worked as a receptionist at Farmer's Insurance. My job focused on making phone calls, writing emails, and general office work. I would make phone calls to banks to remind them of payments. I would also write invoices and offer discounts to clients. As I became more experience with work, my responsibilities grew as well. For example, I was taking claims from clients and estimated how much their insurance rate would be. I also did standard receptionist work, such as printing and shredding paper, and transferring phone calls to the appropriate insurance agent. Overall, that experience taught me much about the work force. I learned the importance of punctuality and teamwork. At first, I struggled with coming to work on time. However, I soon realized that whenever I showed up late, the other insurance agents would work slower because they had to do the tasks that I missed when I was not there. Thus, I started to become more punctual, which the others appreciated. Once I graduate, I hope I can work in a place that was as welcoming as that one. Another experience that would be helpful in a position at a future job would be my volunteering experience. In high school, I worked at several after school programs, known as Apple. At these programs, elementary school students would stay from 3PM to 6Pm, working on homework, learning new material, and playing with other students. Twice a week, I would go volunteer at these programs. I had several responsibilities during this time. I was to look after the children and make sure they were safe. I also had to help them with their homework if they had any questions. It was very interesting to see how teaching methods had changed since I was in elementary school. Personally, I think that the Common Core Standards that elementary students are forced to learn are much more confusing and a waste of time than what I was taught. This volunteering program taught me skills, such as leadership, management, and patience. These skills will greatly benefit me later in life. <br><br>
